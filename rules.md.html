     **Players and Cards**

     ![](https://lh3.ggpht.com/-hmXrp85vE9yI-9miHTUY648s8qcyeEoJsaK48ViQe09Ma2h8G0pAdpzlz7HLtahA8c=s180)

   28 is usually played by four players in fixed partnerships, partners facing each other.
 
32 cards from a standard 52-card pack are used for play. There are eight cards in each of the usual "French" suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades. The cards in every suit rank from high to low: J-9-A-10-K-Q-8-7. The aim of the game is to win tricks containing valuable cards. The values of the cards are:

 - Jacks	3 points each
 - Nines	2 points each
 - Aces	1 point each
 - Tens	1 point each
 - Other cards (K, Q, 8, 7)      	no points

This gives a total of 28 points for cards, hence the name of the game.

Deal and Bidding
============================================================================================================================================

Deal and play are counter-clockwise; the cards are shuffled by the dealer and cut by the player to dealer's left. Four cards are then dealt to each player, one at a time.

Based on these four cards, players bid for the right to choose trumps. Each bid is a number, and the highest bidder undertakes that his or her side will win in tricks at least the number of points bid. The player to dealer's right speaks first, and must bid at least 16. The only exception is if the first player has no point cards at all - only Kings, Queens, 8s and 7s. In this case instead of bidding 14 this player may (but is not obliged to) demand a redeal. All players throw in their cards, there is a new shuffle and cut and the same dealer deals again. The other three players have no right to demand a redeal at this stage however poor their cards may be.

After the first player has bid, subsequent players, in counter-clockwise order, may either bid *higher* or *pass*. The auction continues for as many rounds as necessary until three players pass in succession.

The final bidder chooses a trump suit on the basis of his or her four cards, and places a card of this suit from the set of non-playable cards(2-5) ace down. The trump indicator card is not shown to the other players, who therefore will not know at first what suit is trumps: it remains face down in front of the bidder until at some point during the play someone calls for the trump suit to be exposed.

The dealer then completes the deal, giving four more cards to each player, so that everyone has eight. 

The Play
==============================================================================================================================================
The play can be divided into two phases: before and after the bidder's face down trump card is exposed.

     First phase
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The player to the dealer's right leads to the first trick; players must follow suit if possible, the highest card of the suit led wins the trick, and the winner of each trick leads to the next. If you have no card of the suit led you have two options:

    You may discard any card. This card cannot win the trick.
   Before playing a card, you may call for the bidder's face down trump to be exposed. In this case, the bidder must turn this trump card face up for all to see. Having called for the trump to be exposed, you must play a trump to this trick if you have one; if you have no trump you may discard any card. From the moment when the trump is exposed, the play enters the second phase -see below.

During the first phase, cards of the (concealed) trump suit have no special effect: each trick is won by the highest card of the suit led, even if it also contains cards of the suit that is subsequently revealed as trumps.

     Second phase:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     At the moment when the bidder's face down card is exposed, this suit becomes trumps. Each trick is now won by the highest trump in it. Tricks that contain no trumps are won by the highest card of the suit led. Players must follow suit if possible: if unable to follow, they may play a trump or discard a card of another suit, as they like. As before, the winner of each trick leads to the next.
     
##  Notes:

     Cards of the trump suit only become trumps from the moment that the trump card is exposed. Any cards of that suit that were previously played to the trick do not count as trumps.

    Example. In phase 1 South leads the heart8. Having no hearts, East discards the clubA without asking for trumps, hoping that West will win the trick. North also has no hearts and asks for trumps: the bidder exposes a club and North trumps with the clubQ. West follows suit with the heartA. This trick is won by North. The Queen of clubs is a trump but the Ace of clubs does not count as a trump because it was played before the trump was exposed.


    Redeal
===============================================================================================================================================
In certain circumstances the deal is annulled. The cards are thrown in, the shuffle and cut are repeated and there is a new deal by the same dealer.

   1.  If any player's eight-card hand includes all four jacks, the player must show them and the cards are redealt.

   2.  If it turns out that the bidding team has all 8 trumps, and the other team has none at all, the cards are redealt. This will of course not be known until the trump suit is revealed.
              No Jack discard in an unplayed suit

               If you hold no cards of the suit that is led, it is illegal to discard the Jack of a suit that has not yet been led. It is however, legal to trump with the Jack of trumps even if trumps have not yet been led.

   3.  Pointless hand may demand a Redeal

               If the person who is on the right of the dealer has got all four pointless cards in the first phase itself ,then the game is discarded and a new deal is made by same dealer.

   4.  Any player has a hand of 8 pointless cards (i.e. holds no Jacks, Nines, Aces or Tens) may show it and annul the hand. There is a new deal by the same dealer.


Scoring
     ================================================================================================================================================
     
When all eight tricks have been played, each side counts the card points in the tricks it has won. The bidding team needs at least as many card points as the bid to win; otherwise they lose.
